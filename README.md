#Passive-Network-Monitoring

Passive network monitoring tool using Libpcap packet capture library. 
Captures traffic in promiscous mode or reads packets from pcap trace file. Dumps output in a fashion similar to tcpdump. 

To run:

mydump [-i interface] [-r file] [-s string] expression

-i  Live capture from the network device <interface> (e.g., eth0). If not
    specified, mydump should automatically select a default interface to
    listen on. Capture should continue indefinitely until the user
    terminates the program.

-r  Read packets from <file> in tcpdump format.

-s  Keep only packets that contain <string> in their payload (after any BPF
    filter is applied). You are not required to implement wildcard or regular
    expression matching. A simple string matching operation should suffice.


Sample output:
